Processs 1:
Picking different fluids 
--> pick 1 tip at a time, transfer to microcope 

Process 2:
Send to microscope for analyzing with the OpenCV algorithm

PARAM TEACHING:
    Connecting to the robot: 
        robot.connect()

    Defining labware: 
        You need to load labware onto the robot using labware.load()
        
    Defining instruments (pipettes): 
        You need to define which pipette you are using and its parameters using instruments.P300_Single() 
        (or another appropriate class depending on your pipette)

    Defining your protocol steps: 
        Write the steps of your protocol as functions. In this template, run_protocol() is defined as an example

    Running the protocol: 
        Call the function where you've defined your protocol steps

    Disconnecting from the robot: A
        lways disconnect from the robot when your script finishes running using robot.disconnect()

    Make sure to replace the labware and pipette types with those appropriate for your experiment. 
    Also, ensure that your protocol steps are correct for your specific experiment.
